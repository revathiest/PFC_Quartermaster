# Multi-Server Support Plan

This document outlines the work required to make the bot operate across multiple Discord servers.

## 1. Configuration Refactor
- **Current**: `config.json` stores a single `guildId` and other values.
- **Needed**:
  - Introduce a database table or JSON store for per-guild settings (channel IDs, role mappings, org tag, etc.).
  - Remove the hard-coded `guildId` from command registration and use global commands or register per guild dynamically when the bot joins a server.
  - Update `configLoader` and related utilities to read settings per guild.
  - Move global-only fields like `wallOfFameChannelId` into the per-guild configuration structure.

## 2. Command Registration
- **Current**: `utils/commandRegistration.js` registers commands using `Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId)` which limits them to one server【F:utils/commandRegistration.js†L9-L33】.
- **Needed**:
  - Use global registration (`Routes.applicationCommands`) or iterate over guilds and register commands for each guild upon joining.
  - Ensure commands are registered when the bot is invited to a new server.

## 3. Server‑Specific Strings
- **Current**: Many files contain hard‑coded references to "Pyro Freelancer Corps" and the `PFCS` org ID, e.g. in `updaterules.js`【F:botactions/updaterules.js†L42-L66】, scheduled announcements【F:botactions/scheduling/scheduledAnnouncementEngine.js†L31-L37】 and verification logic【F:commands/user/verify.js†L96-L114】.
- **Needed**:
  - Replace these with values loaded from per‑guild configuration.
  - Allow each guild to define its own default author text, footer, and org ID if used.
  - Parameterize any PFC branding such as icon URLs, "PFC Quartermaster" author strings, and responses in `messages.json`.

## 4. Channel and Role Mapping
- **Current**: `channelRegistry.js` expects specific channel names like `pfc-bot-activity-log` and assigns them to properties on the client object【F:botactions/channelManagement/channelRegistry.js†L3-L27】.
- **Needed**:
  - Store channel mappings per guild in configuration.
  - Update code to read mappings dynamically and fall back gracefully if a channel is missing.
  - Update utilities like `channelSelector.js` which reference hard-coded category names (`PFCS Channels`) so categories can be configured per guild.

## 5. Org‑Specific Logic
- **Current**: Verification and role assignment assume the target organization is `PFCS`【F:commands/user/verify.js†L96-L114】【F:commands/admin/manual-verify.js†L27-L60】.
- **Needed**:
  - Parameterize the target organization ID and roles so any server can define their own verification rules.
  - Update tests that assert `PFCS` to use configurable values.
  - Review other commands that assume `PFCS` membership such as `orgstatus`, `sync-org-ranks`, and `addaccolade`; make them respect the per-guild org configuration and role names (`Recruit`, `Ensign`, etc.).

## 6. Database Schema Updates
- **Potential Work**:
  - Add tables for guild settings (server ID, org ID, channel IDs, roles).
  - Migrate existing data accordingly and update Sequelize models.

## 7. Invite & Onboarding Flow
- Implement logic for the bot to handle the `guildCreate` event:
  - Initialize default settings for the new guild.
  - Register slash commands for that guild if using guild‑specific commands.

## 8. Documentation and Tests
- Update README with instructions for multi‑server configuration.
- Extend unit tests to cover per‑guild configuration paths.

## 9. Remove Single‑Guild Assumptions
- Several modules call `client.guilds.cache.first()` or otherwise assume only one guild is active, e.g. org tag syncing, nickname sweeps, inactive user cleanup, and event synchronization.
- Refactor these utilities to operate on the guild associated with the current event or iterate over all guilds.

By addressing these areas, the bot will be able to function fully when invited to any server, instead of being restricted to a single guild.
