# Multi-Server Support Plan

This document outlines the work required to make the bot operate across multiple Discord servers.

## 1. Configuration Refactor
- **Current**: `config.json` stores a single `guildId` and other values.
- **Needed**:
  - Introduce a database table or JSON store for per-guild settings (channel IDs, role mappings, org tag, etc.).
  - Remove the hard-coded `guildId` from command registration and use global commands or register per guild dynamically when the bot joins a server.
  - Update `configLoader` and related utilities to read settings per guild.
  - Move global-only fields like `wallOfFameChannelId` into the per-guild configuration structure.

## 2. Command Registration
- **Current**: `utils/commandRegistration.js` registers commands using `Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId)` which limits them to one server【F:utils/commandRegistration.js†L9-L33】.
- **Needed**:
  - Use global registration (`Routes.applicationCommands`) or iterate over guilds and register commands for each guild upon joining.
  - Ensure commands are registered when the bot is invited to a new server.

## 3. Server‑Specific Strings
- **Current**: Many files contain hard‑coded references to "Pyro Freelancer Corps" and the `PFCS` org ID, e.g. in `updaterules.js`【F:botactions/updaterules.js†L42-L66】, scheduled announcements【F:botactions/scheduling/scheduledAnnouncementEngine.js†L31-L37】 and verification logic【F:commands/user/verify.js†L96-L114】.
- **Needed**:
  - Replace these with values loaded from per‑guild configuration.
  - Allow each guild to define its own default author text, footer, and org ID if used.
  - Parameterize any PFC branding such as icon URLs, "PFC Quartermaster" author strings, and responses in `messages.json`.

## 4. Channel and Role Mapping
- **Current**: `channelRegistry.js` expects specific channel names like `pfc-bot-activity-log` and assigns them to properties on the client object【F:botactions/channelManagement/channelRegistry.js†L3-L27】.
- **Needed**:
  - Store channel mappings per guild in configuration.
  - Update code to read mappings dynamically and fall back gracefully if a channel is missing.
  - Update utilities like `channelSelector.js` which reference hard-coded category names (`PFCS Channels`) so categories can be configured per guild.

## 5. Org‑Specific Logic
- **Current**: Verification and role assignment assume the target organization is `PFCS`【F:commands/user/verify.js†L96-L114】【F:commands/admin/manual-verify.js†L27-L60】.
- **Needed**:
  - Parameterize the target organization ID and roles so any server can define their own verification rules.
  - Update tests that assert `PFCS` to use configurable values.
  - Review other commands that assume `PFCS` membership such as `orgstatus`, `sync-org-ranks`, and `addaccolade`; make them respect the per-guild org configuration and role names (`Recruit`, `Ensign`, etc.).

## 6. Database Schema Updates
- **Potential Work**:
  - Add tables for guild settings (server ID, org ID, channel IDs, roles).
  - Migrate existing data accordingly and update Sequelize models.

## 7. Invite & Onboarding Flow
- Implement logic for the bot to handle the `guildCreate` event:
  - Initialize default settings for the new guild.
  - Register slash commands for that guild if using guild‑specific commands.

## 8. Documentation and Tests
- Update README with instructions for multi‑server configuration.
- Extend unit tests to cover per‑guild configuration paths.

## 9. Remove Single‑Guild Assumptions
- Several modules call `client.guilds.cache.first()` or otherwise assume only one guild is active, e.g. org tag syncing, nickname sweeps, inactive user cleanup, and event synchronization.
- Refactor these utilities to operate on the guild associated with the current event or iterate over all guilds.

## 10. Configurable Admin Roles
- **Current**: Admin commands check for hard-coded roles like `Admiral` and `Fleet Admiral`, e.g. `deleteannouncements.js`【F:commands/admin/deleteannouncements.js†L4-L20】 and `schedule.js`【F:commands/admin/schedule.js†L11-L12】.
- **Needed**:
  - Load required admin roles from the per-guild configuration.
  - Allow each server to define its own administrator role names.

## 11. Guild-Aware Ambient Engine
- **Current**: `ambientEngine.js` loads allowed channels and settings without scoping to a guild, using `findAll()` and `findOne()` regardless of `guildId`【F:botactions/ambient/ambientEngine.js†L11-L26】.
- **Needed**:
  - Query `AmbientChannel` and `AmbientSetting` by guild.
  - Store per-guild activity state so ambient messages remain isolated to each server.

## 12. Server-Specific Rules Tables
- **Current**: `updaterules.js` reads from tables `PFC_RULES` and `PFC_BOT_RULES_EMBED` and embeds PFC-branded text in the rules message【F:botactions/updaterules.js†L28-L66】.
- **Needed**:
  - Use generic table names or include the guild ID as part of the schema.
  - Replace hard-coded PFC text with values from configuration.

By addressing these areas, the bot will be able to function fully when invited to any server, instead of being restricted to a single guild.
