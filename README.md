# Pyro Freelancers Corps (PFC) Quartermaster Bot

A powerful Discord bot built for the **Pyro Freelancers Corps**, designed to manage trading data, user interactions, and event logging for **Star Citizen** players.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Slash command support
- ‚úÖ Dynamic command registration
- ‚úÖ Sequelize ORM integration
- ‚úÖ Event-driven architecture (reaction adds/removes, message updates, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Log file creation & Discord log channel syncing
- ‚úÖ Handles guild member updates & role assignments
- ‚úÖ Modular design for scalability
- ‚úÖ `/loglookup` command with user lookup and event dropdown (admin only)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revathiest/PFC_Quartermaster.git
cd PFC_Quartermaster
```

Install dependencies and run tests:
> **Note:** The bot requires **Node.js 22.13.1**, as specified in `package.json`.
> Using other versions may lead to unexpected issues.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the full setup (install + tests):

```bash
npm run setup
```

The `setup` script runs `npm ci` to ensure a clean install and executes the test
suite. Running `npm install` separately is unnecessary.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the project root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "token": "your-discord-bot-token",
  "guildId": "your-discord-guild-id",
  "clientId": "your-discord-client-id",
  "SCAPIkey": "your-star-citizen-api-key",
  "botPermsReq": "2147483648",
  "bot_type": "Development",
  "wallOfFameChannelId": "your-wall-of-fame-channel-id"
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This file contains sensitive information.  
> Be sure to **add `config.json` to `.gitignore`** to avoid committing it.

Each field is required:

- `token`: Your Discord bot token
- `guildId`: ID of the Discord server where the bot operates
- `clientId`: Your bot's Discord client ID
- `SCAPIkey`: API key for external services (e.g. Star Citizen)
- `botPermsReq`: Bot permissions integer (default `2147483648`)
- `bot_type`: `"Development"` or `"Production"`
- `wallOfFameChannelId`: Channel ID for special logging/events

Create a `databaseConfig.json` file in the project root for database settings.  
`config/database.js` loads this file based on the `bot_type` value (`development` or `production`).  
A minimal example is:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "pfc_db",
    "username": "db_user",
    "password": "db_pass",
    "dialect": "postgres",
    "logging": false
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This file contains sensitive information.  
> Be sure to **add `databaseConfig.json` to `.gitignore`** to avoid committing it.

Fields include:
- `host`: Database host address
- `database`: Database name
- `username`: Database user
- `password`: Password for the database user
- `dialect`: Sequelize dialect (`postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, etc.)
- `logging`: `true` to log SQL queries, `false` to disable

## üåê Environment Variables

The bot also relies on several environment variables. The project uses
[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to load a `.env` file in the
project root, or you can export them in your shell before running the bot.

- `BOT_TYPE` - Selects the runtime environment for the database and other
  settings. Defaults to `development` if not provided.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key used for OpenAI requests.
- `OPENAI_MODEL` - Model name to use when calling the OpenAI API.
- `UEX_API_TOKEN` - Authentication token for the UEX trading API.
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` - Path to your service account JSON key for Google Drive access.

## üóÑÔ∏è Google Drive Setup

1. Create a service account in the Google Cloud console and enable the **Drive API**.
2. Download the JSON key file for that service account.
3. Save the file somewhere safe, e.g. `google-service-account.json`, and add the filename to `.gitignore`.
4. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` to the path of this JSON file.
5. The bot will use these credentials to authenticate when accessing Google Drive.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

Run the bot:

```bash
node bot.js
```

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
node bot.js
```

Restart the command after each change, or use a tool like `nodemon` to
watch your files and automatically restart the bot during development.
